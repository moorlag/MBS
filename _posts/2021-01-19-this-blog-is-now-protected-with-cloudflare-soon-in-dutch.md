My blog is now HTTPS enabled. And in case of a DDoS attack the traffic is handeled externally and best of all tt’s free! Cloudflare is a ‘content delivery network’ service. Basically is helps the web server to serve the website in a durable way to visitors (and prevents attackers from accessing the website).

## Implementing

During the implementation, I used the knowledge base a lot. Feel free to speed up the process of implementing with these links.

It was really easy to start using Cloudflare. Together with Google Domains, it is easy to use and even easier to manage.
