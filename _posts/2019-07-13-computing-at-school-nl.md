*Goals computing at school Netherlands**

(draft CAS-NL alpha-0.4 based on [CAS-UK](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk))

- *<span style="font-weight: 400;">promoting and supporting excellent computer science education for all students in primary and secondary education</span>*
- *<span style="font-weight: 400;">each student has the option of attending excellent and suitable computer science courses.</span>*

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means ensuring a good base of support, at every relevant level and in respect of all parties involved: the education sector, political circles, business community and students. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span>**Excellent**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> means a solid conceptual basis; captivating, topical and relevant contexts, recognisable for the students. </span>

**Implementation**<span style="font-weight: 400;">: Digital Literacy as a compulsory basis in the learning standards for primary education and the first stage of secondary education. Optional in-depth computer science course in the second stage of secondary education.</span>

**Suitable**<span style="font-weight: 400;">: Each student has the option of taking computer science as an optional course, with optional themes that are suitable for his or her level and interest. We will encourage students to master the skills for the benefit of their future.</span>

### **Goals at the school level**

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools (school management, teachers, parents, students) consider computer science an important, stimulating and “respectable” subject.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">School management and teachers are “digitally literate”.</span>

### **Goals computer science teachers**

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer science teachers are enthusiastic, competent and qualified.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer science teachers are aware of the current developments in computer science/ICT (and in the field of learning and innovation).</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer science teachers have a network of colleagues, ICT/computer science experts and professionals that can provide support in respect of their teaching.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">The profession of computer science/ICT teacher becomes an attractive career for computer science/ICT students. </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sufficient computer science teachers” or: the shortage of computer science teachers does not form a problem for schools that wish to offer this subject in a responsible manner.</span>

## **“CAS-NL community”**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CAS is a community of persons who endorse these goals and wish to contribute towards them. The community is made up of teachers, parents, professionals, businesses, training institutes, government institutions, semi-public institutions, and other interested parties not yet specified. The community is “inclusive”, and is open to everyone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing and maintaining the CAS-NL Community requires expertise, financial resources, human resources, organisation and an infrastructure.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deployment of the resources varies as regards support and options.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Organisations that have been approached. (selected short list)</span>

- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">i&amp;i (association of computer science teachers)</span>](http://www.ieni.org)
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">computer science support centres and teaching methodologists </span>
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">SLO (Netherlands Institute for curriculum development)</span>](http://www.slo.nl)
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">HBO-ICT (Higher Education computer science and ICT study programmes)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nederland ICT](http://www.Nederland-ict.nl); CIO Platform</span>
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Nederland</span>](http://www.microsoft.nl)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Nederland</span>](http://www.apple.nl)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oracle Nederland</span>](http://www.oracle.nl)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dyade</span>](http://Dyade.nl)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennisnet</span>](http://www.kennisnet.nl)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">TU Delft</span>](http://www.tudelft.nl)

*<span style="font-weight: 400;">In principle, membership of CAS-NL is open to everyone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wishes to support the goals.</span>*

**Contributions businesses and professionals**

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">An advisory role by means of a network of experts and expertise. In particular for providing support in respect of advanced topics/themes; and in respect of the choice of studies/provision of information concerning study programmes.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial, infrastructural and organisational support.</span>

**About innovation in education**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The conceptual basis of computer science has sufficiently crystallised to serve as a sound basis for this education. However, the current context of the technology and the applications still changes at a rapid pace. It is important for the education to link up with the current technology and applications as experienced by the students in their immediate surroundings. This means that continuous adaptation and innovation of the educational material is required.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ambitious goals above cannot be achieved using the traditional educational approach: currently there are too few qualified and competent teachers, and this shortage cannot be resolved in the short term. This means that attention must also be paid to a different, innovative approach of this education. Possible elements include: the deployment of</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">ICT/computer science professionals, for instance in a network supporting teachers and students</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">ICT/computer science students in the classroom and in this network</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">peer learning for students</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">ICT resources</span>
